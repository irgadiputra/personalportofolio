                XYZ Retail, an established retail company, sought to expand into e-commerce to reach a wider audience and streamline its sales 
                processes. They needed a scalable, user-friendly platform to support both desktop and mobile users with features like product 
                browsing, user reviews, secure checkout, and real-time inventory updates.

                <div className="-mt-4">
                I was responsible for building the front-end and back-end components of the platform, ensuring seamless integration with the clientâ€™s
                 inventory and payment systems. The project goal was to create an efficient, high-performing application with a smooth user experience.

                <div className="-mt-4">
                Using React for the front-end, I designed a responsive, intuitive UI focused on user engagement and easy navigation. On the back end,
                 I developed RESTful APIs with Node.js and MongoDB for data management. Additionally, I integrated the platform with AWS to optimize 
                 loading times and set up a CI/CD pipeline for faster deployment and testing. I worked closely with designers and QA to address usability
                  and accessibility standards.

                <div className="-mt-4">
                The project was completed on time, leading to a 35% increase in online sales within the first three months. User feedback highlighted
                 the site's speed and ease of use, and the client reported a substantial reduction in manual inventory management tasks.
